## 🧬 About Me

I'm a **second-year PhD student** at the *Institute of Medical Sciences*, University of Aberdeen, working under **Dr. Hajime Murakami** in the Murakami Lab. My research focuses on understanding the **molecular mechanisms of meiotic recombination initiation**, particularly how **cohesin** and **chromosome axis proteins** coordinate to ensure faithful recombination and chromosome segregation.

🔬 My toolkit includes:
- Advanced **ChIP-seq**
- Crosslinking assays
- Bioinformatics analysis
- Scientific storytelling & data visualization
